### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sydney Levy and I am a Master's in Data Science student at Harvard University (graduating in May 2025). I am interested in the intersection of Machine Learning, Data Science, and Healthcare.  

I am currently working as a Data Science intern at Amazon on the Workforce Solutions Transformative Tech team. 

In the past I have worked at: Facebook (Data Science Intern) and Morgan Stanley (in Technology Equity Capital Markets).
