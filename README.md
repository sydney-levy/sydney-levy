### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Sydney Levy and I am a Master's in Data Science student at Harvard University (graduating in May 2024). I am interested in the intersection of Machine Learning, Data Science, and Healthcare.  

In the past I have worked at: Facebook (Data Science Intern) and Morgan Stanley (in Technology Equity Capital Markets).
